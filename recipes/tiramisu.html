    <h3>Ingredients (8 yields)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp (125g) Sugar</li>
      <li>1 2/3 cups (400ml) Heavy cream, cold</li>
      <li>14 oz (425g) Mascarpone cheese, room temperature</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1½ cups brewed espresso</li>
      <li>36-40 Savoiardi biscuits (Ladyfingers)</li>
      <li>2-3 tablespoons coffee liqueur/marsala/brandy</li>
      <li>Cocoa for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the coffee syrup: mix hot coffee with the liqueur, pour into a
        large dish and set aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the filling: place egg yolks and sugar in a large heatproof bowl
        and set over pot with simmering water (bain marie). Make sure the bottom
        of the bowl does not touch the water. start whisking constantly, until
        the sugar is dissolved, and the custard thickens. The temperate of egg
        yolk should reach 154-158ºF (68-70ºC). This step is optional (read
        notes). remove the bowl from heat and let cool.
      </li>

      <li>Add the mascarpone, vanilla extract and whisk until smooth.</li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl whip cold heavy cream to stiff peaks. Fold 1/3 of
        the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture. Then the remaining
        whipped cream. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble: dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for 1-2
        seconds. Place in the bottom of a 9x13 inch (22X33cm) dish. If needed,
        break a few ladyfingers to fit them in the dish. Spread half of the
        cream over the soaked ladyfingers. Repeat with another layer of
        ladyfingers and spread the remaining cream on top. Cover and refrigerate
        the tiramisu for at least 6 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Just before serving, dust with cocoa powder.</li>
